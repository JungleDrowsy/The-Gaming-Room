# The-Gaming-Room
CS230 class 

Client and Software Requirements: The Gaming Room is a gaming company that needed a software platform for users to manage their game libraries, chat with fellow gamers, discover new games, and watch live streams.

What I did well: I was successful at understanding the client's requirements, turning them into clear software specifications, and creating a design that's flexible and scalable for future growth.

Benefits of Design Documents: Working with a design document helped me stay organized, identify possible challenges, and communicate better with everyone involved. It made the development process more efficient and well-planned.

What I'd revise: If I had to pick one thing to improve, I'd focus on enhancing the user experience and interface design. I would conduct more user research, gather feedback, and make design adjustments based on that.

Interpreting User Needs: I figured out what users wanted by talking to gamers and analyzing their needs, preferences, and expectations. It's super important to think about user needs when designing software, because if the product doesn't match what users want, it won't succeed.

Designing Software Approach: I used a mix of agile methods and user-centered design principles when working on the software. For future projects, I'll stick with these approaches and also try out new techniques like rapid prototyping, data-driven design, and competitive analysis to make the software even better.
